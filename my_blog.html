      <li> The Commute to Google </li>
        <p> The commute to google was something I was very nervous about. I
          never have been on public transportation, especially not alone. I had
          to travel from Garfield, Nj to New York City. Thaat is something that
          made me extremely anxious considering I have always been prone to being
          clumsy and getting lost. The first day I was so anxious and was trying
          to find my way around everything from train to train. I even accidentally
          activated the wrong tickey for my train and had to buy a new one. However,
          I feel in time I may be able to get used to this commute. It is something
          that I am learning from and an experience that I had to encounter in my life.
          It is teaching me how to become more independent and feel more comfortable.
